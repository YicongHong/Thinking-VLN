Ideas and thoughts about the fascinating [Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://panderson.me/). :smiley:

Well... it has been three years, [WHERE IS MY SPOON???](https://bringmeaspoon.org/) :expressionless::expressionless::expressionless:

### Before worrying about the spoon

"*You shouldn't feel bad when someone else publishes a paper on the same idea you have been working on. That means we are on the right track and we have one less problem to solve. We can now focus on more interesting ideas.*" --- [Prof. Stephen Gould](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sgould/), my supervisor. :wink:

Cats are extremely helpful to research! I do [cloud cat-petting](https://space.bilibili.com/298946431/) everyday. Really hope I can have one by my side. :smiley_cat::kissing_cat:

"*I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.*" --- [Blade Runner 1982](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/).
